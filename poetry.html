                          Couch Paintings<br>
Here’s a pretty one.<br>
Nondescript descriptors of a picturesque scene.
The more detail added, the less that gets seen.
Burning in the image that the greenery’s green.<br>
Is it still pretty?<br>
Yes, roses grow on the hedgerows on the edge
Red and green. The sky, they, with paint, do allege
Is blue, but it’s really a grey dreary dredge.<br>
It's pretty for what?<br>
Toss a cloud in the sky, hope the world bites it’s lip.
A lie about the sky manufactured for a tip.
Is life the beauty, or is life in beauty’s grip?<br>
Why is it pretty?<br>
Eye after eye passes by where it’s stood.
Drinking from the cup of common courtesy, “Good,”
May be muttered ‘cause they like it. Most would.<br>
Therefore, it’s pretty.

                            Paradise<br>
Are we to, before our time,
bury all the children?
Their constitution serves them less
than ours does us,
both in soul and politics,
so who are we to say
we die before the young,
taking their space in paradise?<br>
When the door to eternity
is blocked by men tied by chains
to brick and mortar trees,
picket signs reading
"stop the succession of time,"
poor children must find a path
that leads to an alternate paradise.<br>
Once at the threshold,
having no spouse,
they cross alone into the dark
clinging to ignorant books
about metal sky machines,
as if that is an achievement
worthy of the title of paradise.<br>
The small ones bite.
The larger ones think.
The middle ones yearn for home,
But as the liquid curtain of black
is cut by their nimble fingers
they all become nothing:
a unity more sound than paradise.<br>
Maybe, if our selfishness
persuades us to do good,
the pebbled path we walk upon,
which breaks beneath our feet,
might stand the beating
of infinite children
on their way to paradise.

                            Sickness<br>
Take a clock on a wall for example.
Examine the way that it stays.
It flicks with a stick to show us the numbers,
And that is the game that it plays.<br>
Next take a look at a fan on a desk.
Stare at its rotating fins.
It swings round and round to give us some comfort,
And there the complexity ends.<br>
Lastly, please, picture a ball full of meat,
connected together by web.
By magic, imagine, a bright lightning-pulse,
It’s shimmering flow and its ebb.<br>
Gently consider that each of these pulses
tells the next what to do,
and all these together take charge of a body;
Imagine that body is you.<br>
Now one of those webbings of lightning-charged meat,
will send a bad message perhaps,
‘This is a problem,’ or ‘We are in danger’
Or ‘This body is bound to collapse.’<br>
We don’t see a clock or a fan messing up,
If it does, we can fix it real quick,
But we aren’t a clock, or a fan, or a car,
We are people who sometimes get sick.<br>
‘Sick’ is a word that us people have made
To make sense of that weird sort of break,
The kind that won’t fix from a handyman’s hand,
But is fixed by the magic we make.<br>
‘Magic’ is something we don’t understand,
But we sure hope that someday we do.
But since everyone everywhere knows different things,
Something old could be magic to you.<br>
So lift up your chin to the top of the sky,
And think what your body can do!
Magical, mystical, wonderful things,
So what is some ‘sickness’ to you?

What’s it called when blooms bloom in reverse?
They shrink their buds into a cold cocoon,
waiting for the end of winter’s curse.
Though it could be considered benefit.

Without the death of rose buds and the leaves
falling to the ground, nature is paused.
For the evergreen, stood by its name,
is, at winter, felled upon the ground,

boasting celebration through tradition,
while harboring an ages long suspicion
of things that do not fall when autumn comes.
Cold’s curse, then, is mere necessity.

	We ponder on the death of life too much,
	But the life of death’s out of our touch.
